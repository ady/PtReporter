This needs to be public facing so that a) staff can access it from anywhere, and b) clients can access the client portal.

We should install the latest version - V5.0.4.
The source is here - http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/vtigercrm/vtigercrm-5.0.4.bin?download
We also need the Customer Portal here - http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/vtigercrm/vtigercrm-customerportal-5.0.4.zip?download

I think this should be loaded onto something like www.public-i.info/crm for ease of memory!
But I'll accept whatever ideas you guys think is best.

Can you also let me know the admin username and password is so I can start adding users etc?

Thanks ...

widget layout pages for citizenscape admin

I thought I'd have a go at widget layout pages for citizenscape admin today. (Probably take me a bit longer than just today:-)). The rest of this mail should generally spec out what I think the page should do/ look like before I start, any comments feel free to come and chat about it..

The page should know when you go to it what its layout is -that is:
1 col,
2 col,
3 col,
2 row 5 positions,
2 row 6 positions

Possibly at the top a link to change the layout, or back to the admin 'page' view where you can change it. Using css borders, and maybe using tables (not sure yet) and rather like the drag and drop for navigation, put a list of 'not used' widgets with a button for 'add another widget', then a layout that very obviously show the number of columns and or rows with obvious 'position' areas for zelina. What you will be dragging will be the name of the widget in the current language.


",http://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/956108,,,"OK I've finished and styled this in all the layout forms this week. When you change the layout, actually it leaves your properties as they were rather than removing them, so it does the best it can at 'remembering' what your layout was.
Also put a help against it. (Laura Tyler - Jul 17, 2009)","Added a 'Clear widgets to not in use' button, that clears everything down. This can be used if something looks wrong in the layout - e.g. you get two of the same widget. -shouldn't happen, but did a lot in debug and dev! (Laura Tyler - Jul 20, 2009)"

1, 'all links from this widget do this job'.
2, 'lightbox': Open a lightbox and put the content of that link into it..
To open a lightbox we use the code:
onclick=>open_target('lightbox', url), where for blogs and for links that can include widget content from citizenscape, we make up url itself using the 'justwidget' code. For external urls we simply pull in the content to the lightbox -err lightboxes do not like full pages, so we may have to do something here ..or redefine 1 above?
3, 'update a widget'? what does this mean? I think this is the 'pebble in a pond' thing so we use 'onclick code again. But we need some kind of definition on what that is..
4, 'open in a new window' we use the code:
target='_blank' to open a new window.. (Laura Tyler - Sep 18, 2009)","I guess I still need to clarify point 1, for blogs we put in a link to all of the blog headings to open a lightbox. what is in the lightbox is a magic widget  that we have defined as the content of the blog post -or a single entry..

Each of the models here have a direct relation to the citizenscape id, so there is a simple validation check that can be done on the citizenscape id.

I'm adding another validation check on delete for the citizenscape id for all of the above, also for  certain of the admin pages I will check and throw the user back to the /portal/security page. 
To mentions some specific views, the edit widget view will trow you back unless you are a super user, but superusers editing widgets that do not belong to the site they are on could cause errors in the widgets they edit -perhaps this page needs to be read only or something...
For the page layout view, I've defaulted you back to the default page of the citizenscape you are on.

In terms of the global datasources and use of sources that aren't global like the help. I think that the interface no longer allows you to select other peoples sources.
 I think I'll write a database migration script here to first move the help datasource global, then discover what sources are currently used accross sites, and what widgets and pages are using them, then either delete the widgets or make the sources global.

You have to use overlays and I don't have great examples. May be easier to just put the labels or divs above the map (outside the map).

Yes, the legend appears within the map widget - not necessarily within the map. I would put it underneath (see Tom's viewfinder map legends).

as we are currently developing the xslt that people use most of the time, we choose the correct one to use from those checked in.
There are a few changes to make here:
1, remove the xslt setting from all the existing widgets
2, move the default xslt in the database table to dummy xslt.
3, change the blog and feed widgets to use the correct xslt
dependant on its datasource, I may have some helper functions for this, if there is no setting.
4, make sure there is a text box for xslt in the add setting page.
5, make sure that the default setting comes not from the database, but the same place as the blog and feed widgets get it from.

This will mean that we can just check in changes to the xslt and they will be picked up -unless people add the xslt as a setting.

I think we ask them not to for a little while, warn them its a technical thing and ask them to inform us if they have to -maybe we can code for what they have to do and share it.

Epetition and viewfinder widgets should take you to the right entry. For Blogs at the moment it will take you to the whole entry, this is because I haven't worked out how to url encode the uri that is used as the unique id here.

I've done some degradation work on the refresh icon too. It should now refresh the page then take you back to the widget.

Other places that use Javascript on the main site are as follows:
The google map widget
The flickr widget
The twitter updater in the panel
The whats new updater
The travelling widget (POC)
RPX

twitter isn't really a datasource as you currently go there using username and password settings. so the tag cloud widget needed to get the data in the same way as the twitter widget at the relevent time. We really do not know what timeline/direct messages are being used/likely to be used, so the tag cloud widget gets tags from all of them.
On the listening side the twitter search view is used with the tag to update it. Actually this is slightly different from the wordpress blog filtering because if there are no results from the search the widget will still update to show no results, the wordpress blog will update to show everything if there are no tags. However for twitter there are a lot of terms so you have less chance of having no results.",http://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/2520587,,

The change made (second check in) was to: 
firstly not show a null datasource at all on the edit page if the datasource options are only null. e.g. for the whats new page widget, the datasource comes from elsewhere so the database gives only the option of a null datasource.
secondly to not show the Edit button on the null datasource when null datasource is part of the datasource options in a list, e.g. for map widgets you can have no datasource for the map or you can have any number of sources that have geodata.

When they during the weekend tried to send a message to all their supporters, only the headline of the message came up in the mail people received.  You will find the text that appeared bold in the bottom of this mail, while they were originally writing a long text.

They want an explanation on why the system doesn'nt work as it should.

Scrollable was previously removed because display widgets didn't need or want it.",http://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/2592095,,,"Just to comment that I've looked into this a bit more. You can set a height on the modal window in the target type javascript which will make the window scrollable, the window defaults to being just the right size for the content, but not to being scrollable. Modalbox.js does the sizing.

I think that we don't want to make it just one size, we want to allow it to grow unless the content size is too large for the page, so we need an indicator of content size.
The xslt open_target that puts in the onclick event for target type has access to the content and can give a parameter for content size or do the logic to set the 'height' parameter.

In fact the solution to this was not the scrollable div at all (which I tried first) so I've upped the number of points against this task..

Clicking on ‘Copy this widget’ displays the two ‘required field errors’ and a distorted help contents at right.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. http://dev.demo.citizenscape.net/core/admin/admin_widget/edit/421 with Administrator rights.
2. Click on ‘Copy this widget’ button.
3. Observe the page, the errors displayed, the static text at the right.

**Observed Behavior:**

As seen in screenshot, the errors are displayed. The static text is displayed a bit distorted.

**Expected Behavior:**

As a user, I just copied the widget. I know that I have to fill in the details before I click ‘Submit’ button. The static text at right must also be displayed correctly like on other pages.

 (Laura Tyler - Apr 21, 2010)","Here are some notes of my investigation on the subject:
Looks like '_edit_widget_col_2.php' which builds the copy form does not cater for:
1, multiple datasources (not really relevant to tag cloud widget)
2, The tag cloud and whats new widget seem to have '0' datasources (which is causing the extra error
3, The settings for twitter etc are not present in the default setting table and there fore not 'unique', which the copy form doen't cater for.
4, xslt setting  seems to have remained in the form from some earlier changes.

Testing for this should happen for all of the newer widgets including tag cloud, whats new and twitter..

_We've had a request from Sweden that they want to take their petitions status bar off at the top of their epetitions. 
  
 Initially they were told they couldn't because it would affect all sites, but Mattias has emailed a solution which would only affect the Swedish template below. 
  
 The following changes can be made in the Malmö specific templates already customized for Malmö without touching the core system: 
  
 1. In the img src reference to the AddThis image, there is one slash too many (three ///) causing Internet Explorer to not display the image. The src attribute should be 
  
 http://www.malmo.se/assets/img/share-this.png 
  
 2. In the AddThis Javascript configuration code, there is an ecoding problem with the ""ö"" in Malmö. The easiest way to get this right is to escape the character like this: 
  
 var addthis_brand = ""Malm&ouml; stad""; 
  
 3. To make it possible for us to hide the status workflow for an initiative, it would be best if you could add a class to the <p> element that contains the status: 
  
 <p class=""status-info""> 
  
 Then we can set the display property in the CSS hosted at our side._

See PH for more details.

Here are donald's notes directly from vTiger...

Eden have reviewed the dev Eden petitions site and have the following observations: 
  
 Registration: 
 1. there is a piece of text 'uri' that doesn't seem to be doing anything. 
 This appears after you select 'Register', complete the initial details and then onto the full registration form. You'll notice this at the top of the form and I have noticed it on the Demo site too. 
  
 2. the Site emails filed needs explanation as to what it is for (I don't know so the average user won't either) 
 Maybe we need a simple one-liner after this dropdown to briefly explain what it is for. 
  
 Add a petition page: 
 3. I think it needs info to say that the start date must be after today rather than wait until the user tries to submit and gets the message. 
 Again, perhaps a one-liner on the form about the date??",http://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/4088275,,

 Dave, 
  
 We were thinking of presenting the app in an i-frame in one of our CMS templates - similar to this page - http://www.braintree.gov.uk/Braintree/greenheartofessex/default.htm (the central block of content is pulled into the page via a URL) - that way the top, left hand & bottom navigation & branding will always be in sync with the site. 
  
 Is it possible to set it up this way? If so the app would need very little branding - just the standard font (Ariel) & possibly colours. 
  
 What do you think? 
  
 Martyn

 Hi Hayley/Martyn, 
  
 Nice to see you on Wednesday and I hope that you are both well. 
  
 Here is a list of action points from our meeting: 
  
 iFrame: Martyn it is completely possible to be able to display the petitions site in an iframe on Braintree DC's website, and it is also possible to take an RSS feed from the site, which might work better. 
 Branding Changes: As mentioned any branding changes to existing BDC corporate ID can be changed manually by us, but not by you. 
 Links: Some links to current sites are: 
 http://epetition.wolverhampton.public-i.tv/ 
 http://epetition.northlincs.public-i.tv/ 
 http://epetition.solihull.public-i.tv 
 http://epetition.bristol.public-i.tv/ 
 http://epetition.kingston.public-i.tv/ 
 http://epetition.birmingham.public-i.tv 
 Comments: The comments feature is to be disabled. 
 Terms & Conditions: HS to send through desired T&C's 
 Postcodes: HS to send through postcode list 
 URL: The desired url for the site is www.epetition.braintree.public-i.tv 
 Members: HS to supply current Member list 
 Confirmation Email Text: HS/MS to confirm validation email body text, including the promotion of other council services/initiatives 
 Front Page: HS to supply new front page body copy. 
  
 If there is anything that we have missed please let me know. As mentioned we will aim to have your development test site up and running within two weeks; dependant on how quickly you can supply the above. 
  
 Thanks, and have good weekends!

there is 1 pair of fails in the core code - our use of autocomplete=off on the username and password fields for legacy login - this came out of the pen testing and is not actually in the xhtml spec - this can be removed as an option - personally I think this is a desktop security issue more that a threat to the site

the kingston site only fails on auto complete and one not self closing image in the template.

In summary - the autocomplete=off can be turned off in options if they want 100% valid xhtml
some templates need tidying up
site would benefit from - The character encoding of each page should be specified within the value of the content attribute (using charset=) on a meta element that also includes an http-equiv attribute set to ""content-type"".

1. Could we look at whether we are able to change the navigation and titles of pages to sentence case i.e Petition guidance instead of Petition Guidance. This may be a CSS style type:-

'Petition Guidance', 'Live Petitions and 'Inactive Petitions' are all in title case but should be in sentence case i.e. only a capital letter for the first word, as this is part of our OSD standards. 

2. Can you look at the CSS for the links as some of the links are displaying different styles to those used on W.Sussex Website and going a light grey which looks like they are dissapearing. The link styles shoudl be consistent with their website, also <li> elements should pick up the small triangles like on http://www.westsussex.gov.uk/living/social_care/adults/care_for_older_people/concessionary_travel.aspx on the petition guidance page they are coming out as standard bullet points :-

Hover over 'Quick test petition' & 'Password reset' and the link disappears. Not good for accessibility, people with visionary issues will really struggle with this. I suggest, if possible, to make it the same as the new internet site, which is when you hover over a link it underlines the link with a blue line. 
'Petitions Guidance' - same as my comment above i.e. underline with a blue line as on our internet site. This will also ensure that there is consistency with the ePettions subsite and the new internet site. This will therefore make it easier for the customer journey too. 

3. Skip to content at the top of header should be lowercase c

4. Make skip to content link work 

5. Make Text Size work (if this is going to take a long time let me know and I'll ask for extra money for development)

6. Get text only going back to normal  (if this is going to take a long time let me know and I'll ask for extra money for development)

7. Display invalid postcodes on ward report (out of area or invalid)

1. Could we look at whether we are able to change the navigation and titles of pages to sentence case i.e Petition guidance instead of Petition Guidance. This may be a CSS style type:-

'Petition Guidance', 'Live Petitions and 'Inactive Petitions' are all in title case but should be in sentence case i.e. only a capital letter for the first word, as this is part of our OSD standards. 

2. Can you look at the CSS for the links as some of the links are displaying different styles to those used on W.Sussex Website and going a light grey which looks like they are dissapearing. The link styles shoudl be consistent with their website, also <li> elements should pick up the small triangles like on http://www.westsussex.gov.uk/living/social_care/adults/care_for_older_people/concessionary_travel.aspx on the petition guidance page they are coming out as standard bullet points :-

Hover over 'Quick test petition' & 'Password reset' and the link disappears. Not good for accessibility, people with visionary issues will really struggle with this. I suggest, if possible, to make it the same as the new internet site, which is when you hover over a link it underlines the link with a blue line. 
'Petitions Guidance' - same as my comment above i.e. underline with a blue line as on our internet site. This will also ensure that there is consistency with the ePettions subsite and the new internet site. This will therefore make it easier for the customer journey too. 

3. Skip to content at the top of header should be lowercase c

4. Make skip to content link work 

5. Make Text Size work (if this is going to take a long time let me know and I'll ask for extra money for development)

""I have been informed that this site is now available to go live and unfortunately I have some concerns with the way our design has been implemented.
 
Firstly the site does not display correctly in Internet Explorer version 6, as this version is used by around 5-10% of our customers it is essential that this is corrected. I have attached a screen shot showing the display in this browser.
 
Secondly the site fails on WAI Web accessibility standards because the pages have no meta data, specifically no page title has been provided. Incidentally the site also fails to pass CSS and HTML verification, which while less important is also one of our targets.
 
The general display of the page does not fit within a standard 1024x768 monitor display, and requires a sideways scroll bar to view the full page, in addition this means that when moving between our main site and this sub-site the screen appears to flicker.
 
There are also several other more minor display issues that I noted.
1/ The spacing between the content and the footer is too large.
2/ The bottom of the content has square corners instead of rounded.
3/ The colours of the menu do not match those on our corporate site.
4/ The mouse over colours for the A-Z links are different to our corporate site.""",http://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/8344357,,,"1  - IE6 - god knows - 4 hours ? 1 minute ?

Hence the problem we have got is that (as both URLs are crawled by Google) the link juice going to these 2 URLs is being reduced to half power, and secondly as different URLs are technically 2 different sites, we are publishing duplicate content which is being penalized. Please let me know if you are ok with losing the URL ""www.marketing.citizenscape.net"". We would have redirects in place for people who are still using the marketing URL.

Currently rejected and withdrawn petitions have been taken out of inactive petitions due to moderation issues.

We need to either advise councils to edit the content of the petition with **** or change the status to withdrawn which will not show the petition in the list at all.

I could modify the main menu to mimic the main site a bit more but unless I have some more detail (browser, specific page/links) I'm not sure what else to do.

3a. Status line: Do they want to remove the status text altogether, or is it a question of how to change the state?

See below email for more details:-

Hello there,
 
We are at the final stages of our website redesign and are due to launch tomorrow.
 
I’m told by the developers that you can pick up all you need to put your sections in the correct style, by looking at the source code on the mantis site and/or the live site tomorrow (http://mantis.brighton-hove.gov.uk/index.cfm).

 If you need any further information or more help, please don’t hesitate to get in contact. Also if you could let me know when your changes are made I’d appreciate it.

 

Thank you,

Emma Shotton""",http://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/10263781,,
